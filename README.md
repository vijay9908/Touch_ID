# Touch_ID-Integration
Makes touch_id on Mac work with sudo commands locally instead of typing a password everytime.

ü§î Why Use This?
       Typing in the password each time when you use sudo or brew commands can be really annoying.Having support for touch_id really helps when it comes to permissions without typing in the password.
       
Added Support:
       Works flawlessly with Mac's having Touch_id and running MacOS Mojave.
